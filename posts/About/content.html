<h2 id="moi">Moi!</h2>
<p>I am Miska, I make very many things. I try not to make too many
things as otherwise my head overflows and I cannot sleep at night. The
picture above is of me at 9 years old on an interrail trip with my
family. I had just gotten a 40 degree (celcius, Iâ€™m Finnish) fever and
was sleeping it off. There are more timely pictures of me, but this is
among the best ones.</p>
<p><img src="./build/About/big-miska.webp" alt="A more recent picture. I am in SodankylÃ¤, Finland
with my partner about to be enlightened at the Midnight sun film festival. I
have the remains of a terrible vegan-not-designed-to-be-vegan pizza grasped
between my thumb, index finger and middle finger. In fact, you can see then name
of the pizza place behind on a sign, but I'm not the type of person to out them
in the alt-text of an image. I am squinting my eyes away from the sun that is
shining very brightly at around 11pm (hence the midnight sun)." />
<span><em>A more timely picture.</em></span></p>
<p>I study computer science at Aalto University in Finland, but really I
study things that are interesting to me and seem meaningful (thus, often
not computer science). Some recent examples are lactic acid fermentation
and reusing or repurposing old electronics.</p>
<p>This website is a kind of compendium of the things I have done/am
doing/will do. It will evolve as I evolve and hence Iâ€™ll probably
rewrite everything (both language and <code>language</code>) several
times during its existence.</p>
<p>Hope you find something interesting here ðŸ”¥</p>
